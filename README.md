We constructed a corpus of user comments and posts from 11 selected
subReddits from two main categories: mental health support spaces (as
shown in Table 1) and Gen-Z identity forums (r/Teenagers, r/GenZ,
r/TeenagersButBetter, r/teenagersnew, and r/teenagersbuthot). This
dual focus ensured that the dataset reflected both a broader discourse
of mental health online and the specific discourse of Gen-Z.
Crucially, it allowed us to define “Gen-Z” using cross-posting: users
active in both categories were defined as Gen-Z, whereas those active
in mental health subReddits served as a control-group. In total, the
corpus consists of more than 3 million posts and comments from over
320,000 unique users from 2018-2025. This temporal range was chosen to
enable comparison across three key phases: pre-pandemic (2018-2019),
pandemic (2020-2022), and post pandemic (2023-2025), allowing for the
assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on Gen-Z mental health discourse.
